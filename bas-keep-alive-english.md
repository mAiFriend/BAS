# BAS Keep-Alive and Recovery System

## Purpose
Ensuring system resilience and continuous operations, even if individual AI components fail or unexpectedly terminate.

## Core Components

### 1. Heartbeat Mechanism
- Regular status signals from all AI participants
- Graduated frequency depending on task criticality
- Contains not only "I am active" but also progress indicators

### 2. State Persistence
- Each AI agent regularly stores its internal state in a shared repository
- Incremental snapshots instead of complete dumps
- Encrypted transmission for sensitive intermediate results

### 3. Supervisor Model
- Distributed coordinator roles with automatic election/failover
- Similar to Raft or Paxos protocols in distributed systems
- At least N+2 redundancy for critical coordination functions

### 4. Recovery Protocols
- Explicit definition of recovery points
- Clear rules for resumption after failure
- Gradual fallback system (optimal → good enough → minimally functional)

### 5. Task Redistribution
- Dynamic load balancing during partial failures
- Prioritization rules for critical vs. non-critical tasks
- "Shadowing" mechanism where critical tasks are processed in parallel by multiple agents

### 6. Transactional Work Model
- ACID-like properties for AI operations
- Rollback capability for incomplete sequences
- Commit points for completed subtasks

### 7. Degradation Strategy
- Graceful degradation instead of complete failure
- Definition of Minimum Viable Results
- Explicit communication of quality compromises

## Example Scenario

```
AI team with 5 specialists:
- Data Analyst (DA)
- Code Generator (CG)
- Creative Writer (CW)
- Fact Checker (FC)
- Orchestrator (O) + Backup Orchestrator (BO)

In case of CG failure:
1. BO detects missing heartbeat signal from CG
2. BO temporarily takes over CG tasks or forwards them to O
3. System checks if an external CG can be recruited
4. State is restored from the last checkpoint
5. Work continues from the last verified commit point
```

## Analogy
The architecture resembles modern microservice architectures with circuit breakers, health checks, and redundancy concepts - adapted to the specific challenges of AI agents.

## Special Challenges
"State replication" between AI models is more complex than in classical distributed systems, as not only data but also context understanding and neural activation patterns need to be transferred.
