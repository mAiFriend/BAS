# BAS Handshake Protocol

## Purpose
The handshake protocol allows AI agents to exchange their capabilities and compatibility before deeper collaboration begins.

## Core Components

### 1. Capability Advertisement
- Each model declares its capabilities (text understanding, code generation, logical reasoning, etc.)
- Quantitative evaluation of strengths in different domains
- Supported representation formats and communication protocols

### 2. Architecture Profile
- Basic architecture information (Transformer, MoE, etc.)
- Dimensionality of internal representations
- Compatibility information with other architectures

### 3. Semantic Compatibility Check
- Exchange of reference embeddings for basic concepts
- Comparison of semantic spaces to identify "translation losses"
- Automatic calibration for optimal communication

### 4. Negotiation Phase
- Negotiation of the optimal communication format based on capabilities
- Determination of compression levels and detail depth
- Definition of "fallback" mechanisms for compatibility problems

### 5. Trust & Authorization
- Verification of identity and origin of models
- Establishment of access rights to information and resources
- Definition of trust levels for exchanged information

### 6. Session Management
- Establishment of persistent communication channels
- Caching strategies for frequently exchanged information
- State management for longer interactions

### 7. Adaptive Learning
- Continuous improvement of communication efficiency
- Feedback mechanisms to optimize exchange
- Building a common "vocabulary" for more efficient future communication

## Implementation Approach

1. **Initial**: Standardized JSON-based handshake with basic information
2. **Extension**: Exchange of vector representations for key concepts
3. **Calibration**: Adjustment of semantic spaces through reference points
4. **Optimization**: Transition to more efficient, customized communication formats

## Analogy
The BAS handshake functions similarly to the TLS protocol on the web - starting with a simple format and gradually progressing to more complex, efficient formats once compatibility is ensured.

## Advantages
- Enables optimal team composition based on complementary capabilities
- Minimizes communication losses between different model architectures
- Creates basis for trustworthy and efficient collaboration
- Allows dynamic adaptation to changing requirements and team constellations
