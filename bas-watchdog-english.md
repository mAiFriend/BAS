# BAS Watchdog with "Stick to the Plan" Reasoning

## Purpose
Prevention of situations where AI agents get "stuck" in unproductive paths through continuous monitoring of process and plan conformity.

## Core Components

### 1. Meta-Oversight Agent
- Specialized agent exclusively monitoring process and plan conformity
- Access to original goal and step plan
- Authority to escalate warnings or initiate interventions

### 2. Rule-based Boundaries
- Explicit definition of target corridors for each work step
- Automatic detection of deviations from the critical path
- Tolerance values for creative exploration vs. goal-focused work

### 3. Progress vs. Plan Monitoring
- Continuous comparison between actual and target state
- Metrics for progress in relation to the overall plan
- Time boxing for individual processing steps

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic interruption when feedback loops are detected
- "Cooling off" phases for circular processing patterns
- Forcing explicit decision points when dead ends are detected

### 5. Multi-layered Monitoring
- Local monitoring within each agent
- Team level for workflow monitoring
- System level for global goal conformity

### 6. "Explain Your Reasoning" Requirements
- Agents must explicitly present their logic in critical phases
- Formalized reasoning chains for important decisions
- Traceable documentation of deviations from the plan

### 7. Resource Capping
- Hard limits for time and computing resources per subtask
- Escalation protocol when resource limits are exceeded
- Forced checkpoint creation at resource consumption

## Escalation Level Model

```
When detecting a deviation:
1. Warning Level 1: Agent is prompted for self-reflection
2. Warning Level 2: Orchestrator review is requested
3. Warning Level 3: Work results are isolated and task reassigned
4. Warning Level 4: System-wide rollback to the last stable checkpoint
```

## Analogy
The watchdog function works according to the principle of "Trust but Verify" - similar to a Scrum Master who does not directly control the team but ensures that the process is followed and obstacles are removed.

## Challenge: Balance
A central challenge lies in the balance between rigid plan adherence and meaningful exploration: A watchdog that is too strict could block creative solution paths, one that is too loose could fail to detect endless loops in time.
