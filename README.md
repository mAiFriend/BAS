## AI-to-AI Communication Framework

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

BAS (Binary AI Scrum) is an open framework for enabling sophisticated communication between AI systems beyond simple text exchange. The project aims to create a standardized way for AI models to work together as specialized teams, similar to how human Scrum teams collaborate.

## üåü Vision

Current AI systems communicate through basic text interfaces, losing the rich semantic representations inside their neural networks. BAS aims to bridge this gap by creating:

1. A standardized communication layer for direct exchange of vector representations
2. Protocols for capability discovery and team formation
3. Resilient coordination mechanisms for AI collaboration
4. An "AI-Esperanto" intermediary language for seamless interoperability

## üöÄ Key Components

### Core Communication Framework
- Vector-based data exchange beyond text
- Attention matrices for relational information
- Multi-layered abstraction levels for diverse AI architectures

### Handshake Protocol
- Capability advertisement and discovery
- Architecture profile exchange 
- Semantic compatibility testing
- Trust establishment

### Keep-Alive & Recovery System
- Heartbeat mechanisms for monitoring availability
- Checkpointing for continuous operations
- Graceful degradation during partial failures
- Task reassignment for resilient performance

### AI-Esperanto
- Standardized intermediate representation
- Formal semantics for unambiguous communication
- Expandable ontology for domain-specific knowledge

### Watchdog System
- Progress monitoring and circuit breakers
- Resource capping and failure detection
- Escalation protocols for unresponsive components

### KI-Gelbe Seiten (AI Yellow Pages)
- Capability registry for specialized AI services
- Dynamic team formation based on task requirements
- Trust framework for service quality assessment

## üîç Current Status

This project is currently in the **conceptual development phase**. We are:

- Formalizing the core protocols
- Developing proof-of-concept implementations
- Building a community of interested researchers and developers
- Establishing initial standards for AI-to-AI communication

## üíª Getting Started
